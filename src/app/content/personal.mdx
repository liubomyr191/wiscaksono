Hey there! So, picture this: I just graduated in Electrical Engineering, but guess what? I stumbled upon a wild and wacky love for Front End Development!
It's been a crazy ride for the past 2 years, but man, I've been sharpening my skills in this field like a master swordsmith. 
I'm so good with React.JS and Next.JS, it's like I can make websites dance the Macarena. And you know what's even more impressive? 
I can take a designer's masterpiece in Figma and turn it into a masterpiece of code. It's like magic, but without the rabbit and hat. 
And let's not forget about my mad skills in TailwindCSS for styling. I can make websites look so fly, they'll have birds lining up to perch on them. 
I'm like the cleanliness guru of code, with my attention to detail and obsession with keeping things organized. So, get ready world, 
'cause this Front End Developer is about to drop some high-quality work and make the internet a brighter and funnier place!
