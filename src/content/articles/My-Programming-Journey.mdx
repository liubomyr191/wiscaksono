# My Programming Journey


At the onset of the pandemic, my college courses were moved online, which left me struggling to keep up with the material and lessons I needed to understand as an electrical engineering student. This made me doubt my own abilities and knowledge in the field. But then, I decided to explore other avenues that may be a better fit for me. That's when I started learning programming, particularly front-end development.

Luckily, I had a friend who was willing to guide and mentor me through the ins and outs of front-end development. Armed with self-taught knowledge, I mustered up the courage to apply for a job as a front-end developer in a private company during my 7th or 8th semester (I can't quite remember).

To my surprise, I was offered the position, and that's how my journey as a front-end developer began after making the switch from electrical engineering.

It was a bold move, but it turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made. Now, as I continue to hone my skills in programming, I am grateful for the unexpected turn of events that led me down this path. Who knows where it may take me next?
